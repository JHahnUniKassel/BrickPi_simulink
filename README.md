# BrickPi_simulink
How to control NXT and EV3 sensors/motors via BrickPi and Simulink/Matlab

This small library contains just a few operations I needed for a project. This is no all-embracing library, and I am no programmer.

1. Insert the Lib-Folder into the Matlab-Path
2. Install "Simulink Support Package for Raspberry Pi Hardware"
3. Use Blocks in Library-Simulink Support Package for BrickPi
